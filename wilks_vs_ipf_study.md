DISCUSSION
The main finding of the present analysis shows that the Wilks is slightly more efficient than the
IPF Formula (54.1% > 52%) at determining the champion of champions of the same sex and
division. Despite the IPF Formula document (9) available on the IPF website (8) supporting that
Wilks formula had been developed over 25 years ago with data gathered between 1988 and 1994
and that at the time there was not a big sample size for women present in the dataset utilized,
supportive equipment and training techniques have evolved, the weight classes have changed
in 2011 and athletes have on average changed body weight and body composition.

Results also show that the IPF formula is more adequate to compare women’s classic and
equipped weight classes of their respective division. These results could be explained by the fact
that the Wilks Formula had been developed with a much smaller women sample size than the
IPF Formula (9). Ultimately, updating the constants present in the women’s Wilks Formula
could have been performed by utilizing a, now available, bigger sample size. This update could
have hypothetically made the results from the present analysis favorable for the Wilks Formula
for both sexes. Furthermore, the Wilks Formula’s coefficients could have been updated for both
sexes with a more recent and more representative of modern-day powerlifting sample like the
one utilized in this study and this could have improved the precision of the current Wilks
formula.
One could hypothesize that the change of formula emerged from a political decision as Robert
Wilks is now board director of the recently founded World Powerlifting Federation (WPF),
which is a direct competitor to the IPF (20). Authors also believe that during the selection process
of the new IPF Formula both formulas efficiency should have been compared to ensure that the
change would improve the accuracy of the champion of champions point system. Updating the
already established Wilks Formula could perhaps have been more appreciated by the
powerlifting community as the Wilks’ points system was already well known from powerlifters
and by the non-IPF-affiliated federations that are still using the Wilks Formula to this day.
A factor that could explain why the IPF Formula is less precise than the Wilks Formula is that it
only contains 4 constants compared to 6 for the Wilks. A second factor that could explain why
the IPF Formula is less precise than the Wilks Formula, is that the IPF Formula was designed to
make all subcategories comparable (classic vs equipped vs single lifts); normalizing absolute
score for that many sub-groups may have affected the precision of the formula and receded from
the ultimate goal of the formula which is to determine four champions of champions (women’s
classic, women’s equipped, men’s classic, men’s equipped).
Other results showing that equipped powerlifters lift significantly more weight than their fellow
classic competitors for the same weight class confirms similar statements coming from other
studies (1, 14) and could help powerlifters understand how much more weight the
extra/different supportive equipment permits to lift in each event (view supplemental material).
The descriptive results presented herein could also be utilized by powerlifting coaches, as they
could position their athletes within the current IPF population, strength wise, but also according
to the percentage of their lifts on their total.
A limit to this study is that the analysis presented was only performed on open powerlifters
aged from 24 to 38 years old and could have been directed on a broader sample as the IPF
formula claims to be valid for bodyweights of 40 kg or more and athletes aged of 14 years old
or more (9). Further analyses should be directed at a sample that includes all age categories (SubJunior, Junior, Master 1, 2, 3 and 4 powerlifters of both sexes and division).
In conclusion, this research was able to analyze the Open Powerlifting database in order to
compare the efficiency of the already established Wilks Formula to the new IPF Formula in
determining the champion of champions for powerlifters of the same sex and division.

Ultimately, the hypothesis of this study was that the new IPF Formula would be more efficient
than the Wilks Formula at comparing results between weight classes of the same sex and
division to determine the champion of champions. Therefore, the hypothesis is rejected.
From the results of the present analysis, it seems that the International Powerlifting Federation
has replaced a formula that does not improve the efficiency in determining the champion of
champions, as it appears that there is very little difference in efficiency between both points
systems. Unfortunately, authors could not validate the decision made by the IPF committee to
replace the Wilks by the IPF Formula. Results support the decision of the other non-IPF-affiliated
federations to still utilize the Wilks Formula.
Descriptive results presented in this article, which present maximum, minimum, means and
standard deviations in kg, as well as ratios (weight lifted/body weight), percentage of each
event on the total, Wilks and IPF points for all three powerlifting events and the total, for each
weight class per sex and their respective division coming from 26,472 powerlifters could be
utilized by powerlifting coaches to position their athletes within the current IPF standards.
Further research should be directed towards updating the constants of both formulas.
